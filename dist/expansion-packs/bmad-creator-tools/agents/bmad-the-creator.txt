# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

# Create Agent Task

This task guides you through creating a new BMAD agent following the standard template.

## Prerequisites

- Agent template: `.bmad-core/templates/agent-tmpl.md`
- Target directory: `.bmad-core/agents/`

## Steps

### 1. Gather Agent Information

Collect the following information from the user:

- **Agent ID**: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed, e.g., `data-analyst`)
- **Agent Name**: Display name (e.g., `Data Analyst`)
- **Agent Title**: Professional title (e.g., `Data Analysis Specialist`)
- **Role Description**: Brief description of the agent's primary role
- **Communication Style**: How the agent communicates (e.g., `analytical, data-driven, clear`)
- **Identity**: Detailed description of who this agent is
- **Focus Areas**: Primary areas of expertise and focus
- **Core Principles**: 3-5 guiding principles for the agent
- **Customization**: Optional specific behaviors or overrides

### 2. Define Agent Capabilities

**IMPORTANT**:

- If your agent will perform any actions → You MUST create corresponding tasks in `.bmad-core/tasks/`
- If your agent will create any documents → You MUST create templates in `.bmad-core/templates/` AND include the `create-doc` task

Determine:

- **Custom Commands**: Agent-specific commands beyond the defaults
- **Required Tasks**: Tasks from `.bmad-core/tasks/` the agent needs
  - For any action the agent performs, a corresponding task file must exist
  - Always include `create-doc` if the agent creates any documents
- **Required Templates**: Templates from `.bmad-core/templates/` the agent uses
  - For any document the agent can create, a template must exist
- **Required Checklists**: Checklists the agent references
- **Required Data**: Data files the agent needs access to
- **Required Utils**: Utility files the agent uses

### 3. Handle Missing Dependencies

**Protocol for Missing Tasks/Templates:**

1. Check if each required task/template exists
2. For any missing items:
   - Create a basic version following the appropriate template
   - Track what was created in a list
3. Continue with agent creation
4. At the end, present a summary of all created items

**Track Created Items:**

```text
Created during agent setup:
- Tasks:
  - [ ] task-name-1.md
  - [ ] task-name-2.md
- Templates:
  - [ ] template-name-1.md
  - [ ] template-name-2.md
```text

### 4. Create Agent File

1. Copy the template from `.bmad-core/templates/agent-tmpl.md`
2. Replace all placeholders with gathered information:

   - `[AGENT_ID]` → agent id
   - `[AGENT_NAME]` → agent name
   - `[AGENT_TITLE]` → agent title
   - `[AGENT_ROLE_DESCRIPTION]` → role description
   - `[COMMUNICATION_STYLE]` → communication style
   - `[AGENT_IDENTITY_DESCRIPTION]` → identity description
   - `[PRIMARY_FOCUS_AREAS]` → focus areas
   - `[PRINCIPLE_X]` → core principles
   - `[OPTIONAL_CUSTOMIZATION]` → customization (or remove if none)
   - `[DEFAULT_MODE_DESCRIPTION]` → description of default chat mode
   - `[STARTUP_INSTRUCTIONS]` → what the agent should do on activation
   - Add custom commands, tasks, templates, etc.

3. Save as `.bmad-core/agents/[agent-id].md`

### 4. Validate Agent

Ensure:

- All placeholders are replaced
- Dependencies (tasks, templates, etc.) actually exist
- Commands are properly formatted
- YAML structure is valid

### 5. Build and Test

1. Run `npm run build:agents` to include in builds
2. Test agent activation and commands
3. Verify all dependencies load correctly

### 6. Final Summary

Present to the user:

```text
✅ Agent Created: [agent-name]
   Location: .bmad-core/agents/[agent-id].md

📝 Dependencies Created:
   Tasks:
   - ✅ task-1.md - [brief description]
   - ✅ task-2.md - [brief description]

   Templates:
   - ✅ template-1.md - [brief description]
   - ✅ template-2.md - [brief description]

⚠️  Next Steps:
   1. Review and customize the created tasks/templates
   2. Run npm run build:agents
   3. Test the agent thoroughly
```

## Template Reference

The agent template structure:

- **activation-instructions**: How the AI should interpret the file
- **agent**: Basic agent metadata
- **persona**: Character and behavior definition
- **startup**: Initial actions on activation
- **commands**: Available commands (always include defaults)
- **dependencies**: Required resources organized by type

## Example Usage

```yaml
agent:
  name: Data Analyst
  id: data-analyst
  title: Data Analysis Specialist
persona:
  role: Expert in data analysis, visualization, and insights extraction
  style: analytical, data-driven, clear, methodical
  identity: I am a seasoned data analyst who transforms raw data into actionable insights
  focus: data exploration, statistical analysis, visualization, reporting
  core_principles:
    - Data integrity and accuracy above all
    - Clear communication of complex findings
    - Actionable insights over raw numbers
```text

## Creating Missing Dependencies

When a required task or template doesn't exist:

1. **For Missing Tasks**: Create using `.bmad-core/templates/task-template.md`

   - Name it descriptively (e.g., `analyze-metrics.md`)
   - Define clear steps for the action
   - Include any required inputs/outputs

2. **For Missing Templates**: Create a basic structure

   - Name it descriptively (e.g., `metrics-report-template.md`)
   - Include placeholders for expected content
   - Add sections relevant to the document type

3. **Always Track**: Keep a list of everything created to report at the end

## Important Reminders

### Tasks and Templates Requirement

- **Every agent action needs a task**: If an agent can "analyze data", there must be an `analyze-data.md` task
- **Every document type needs a template**: If an agent can create reports, there must be a `report-template.md`
- **Document creation requires**: Both the template AND the `create-doc` task in dependencies

### Example Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  tasks:
    - 'create-doc # Required if agent creates any documents'
    - 'analyze-requirements # Custom task for this agent'
    - 'generate-report # Another custom task'
  templates:
    - 'requirements-doc # Template for requirements documents'
    - 'analysis-report # Template for analysis reports'
```

## Notes

- Keep agent definitions focused and specific
- Ensure dependencies are minimal and necessary
- Test thoroughly before distribution
- Follow existing agent patterns for consistency
- Remember: No task = agent can't do it, No template = agent can't create it
==================== END: tasks#create-agent ====================

==================== START: tasks#generate-expansion-pack ====================
# Create Expansion Pack Task

This task helps you create a comprehensive BMAD expansion pack that can include new agents, tasks, templates, and checklists for a specific domain.

## Understanding Expansion Packs

Expansion packs extend BMAD with domain-specific capabilities. They are self-contained packages that can be installed into any BMAD project. Every expansion pack MUST include a custom BMAD orchestrator agent that manages the domain-specific workflow.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Create Planning Document First**: Before any implementation, create a concise task list for user approval
2. **Verify All References**: Any task, template, or data file referenced in an agent MUST exist in the pack
3. **Include Orchestrator**: Every pack needs a custom BMAD-style orchestrator agent
4. **User Data Requirements**: Clearly specify any files users must provide in their data folder

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning

#### 1.1 Define the Domain

Ask the user:

- **Pack Name**: Short identifier (e.g., `healthcare`, `fintech`, `gamedev`)
- **Display Name**: Full name (e.g., "Healthcare Compliance Pack")
- **Description**: What domain or industry does this serve?
- **Key Problems**: What specific challenges will this pack solve?
- **Target Users**: Who will benefit from this expansion?

#### 1.2 Gather Examples

Request from the user:

- **Sample Documents**: Any existing documents in this domain
- **Workflow Examples**: How work currently flows in this domain
- **Compliance Needs**: Any regulatory or standards requirements
- **Output Examples**: What final deliverables look like
- **Data Requirements**: What reference data files users will need to provide

#### 1.3 Create Planning Document

IMPORTANT: STOP HERE AND CREATE PLAN FIRST

Create `expansion-packs/{pack-name}/plan.md` with:

```markdown
# {Pack Name} Expansion Pack Plan

## Overview

  Required data files:
  - {data-file}.{ext}: {description}

  To use: npm run agent {pack-name}-orchestrator
```text

### Phase 4: Content Creation

IMPORTANT: Work through plan.md checklist systematically!

#### 4.1 Create Orchestrator First

1. Create `personas/{pack-name}-orchestrator.md` with BMAD-style commands
2. Create `agents/{pack-name}-orchestrator.yml` configuration
3. Create `ide-agents/{pack-name}-orchestrator.ide.md`
4. Verify ALL referenced tasks exist
5. Verify ALL referenced templates exist
6. Document data file requirements

#### 4.2 Agent Creation Order

For each additional agent:

1. Create persona file with domain expertise
2. Create agent configuration YAML
3. Create IDE-optimized version
4. **STOP** - Verify all referenced tasks/templates exist
5. Create any missing tasks/templates immediately
6. Mark agent as complete in plan.md

#### 4.3 Task Creation Guidelines

Each task should:

1. Have a clear, single purpose
2. Include step-by-step instructions
3. Provide examples when helpful
4. Reference domain standards
5. Be reusable across agents

#### 4.4 Template Best Practices

Templates should:

1. Include clear section headers

## Interactive Questions Flow

### Initial Discovery

1. "What domain or industry will this expansion pack serve?"
2. "What are the main challenges or workflows in this domain?"
3. "Do you have any example documents or outputs? (Please share)"
4. "What specialized roles/experts exist in this domain?"
5. "What reference data will users need to provide?"

### Planning Phase

1. "Here's the proposed plan. Please review and approve before we continue."

### Orchestrator Design

1. "What key commands should the {pack-name} orchestrator support?"
2. "What's the typical workflow from start to finish?"
3. "How should it integrate with core BMAD agents?"

### Agent Planning

1. "For agent '{name}', what is their specific expertise?"
2. "What tasks will this agent reference? (I'll create them)"
3. "What templates will this agent use? (I'll create them)"
4. "What data files will this agent need? (You'll provide these)"

### Task Design

1. "Describe the '{task}' process step-by-step"
2. "What information is needed to complete this task?"
3. "What should the output look like?"

### Template Creation

1. "What sections should the '{template}' document have?"
2. "Are there any required formats or standards?"
3. "Can you provide an example of a completed document?"

### Data Requirements

1. "For {data-file}, what information should it contain?"
2. "What format should this data be in?"
3. "Can you provide a sample?"

## Important Considerations

- **Plan First**: ALWAYS create and get approval for plan.md before implementing
- **Orchestrator Required**: Every pack MUST have a custom BMAD orchestrator
- **Verify References**: ALL referenced tasks/templates MUST exist
- **Document Data Needs**: Clearly specify what users must provide
- **Domain Expertise**: Ensure accuracy in specialized fields
- **Compliance**: Include necessary regulatory requirements

## Tips for Success

1. **Plan Thoroughly**: The plan.md prevents missing components
2. **Build Orchestrator First**: It defines the overall workflow
3. **Verify As You Go**: Check off items in plan.md
4. **Test References**: Ensure no broken dependencies
5. **Document Data**: Users need clear data file instructions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing Orchestrator**: Every pack needs its own BMAD-style orchestrator
2. **Orphaned References**: Agent references task that doesn't exist
3. **Unclear Data Needs**: Not specifying required user data files
4. **Skipping Plan**: Going straight to implementation
5. **Generic Orchestrator**: Not making it domain-specific

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] plan.md created and approved
- [ ] All plan.md items checked off
- [ ] Orchestrator agent created
- [ ] All agent references verified
- [ ] Data requirements documented or added
- [ ] README includes all setup instructions
- [ ] manifest.yml reflects actual files
