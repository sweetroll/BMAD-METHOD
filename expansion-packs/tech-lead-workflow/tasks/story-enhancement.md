# Story Enhancement Task

This task guides the process of enhancing high-level business stories with developer implementation steps, technical decisions, and status updates to bridge business requirements with actionable development work.

## Purpose

Transform approved business stories (status: APPROVED_FOR_REFINEMENT) into enhanced stories (status: PENDING_DEVELOPMENT_APPROVAL) by adding detailed implementation tasks, technical approach, and developer guidance while preserving original business context and user value.

## When to Use This Task

- **After Manual Approval** - When Product Owner has updated story status to APPROVED_FOR_REFINEMENT
- **Before Development Begins** - When implementation team needs actionable development tasks
- **Collaborative Refinement** - When technical approach needs developer input and agreement
- **Status Transition** - When moving story from APPROVED_FOR_REFINEMENT to PENDING_DEVELOPMENT_APPROVAL

## Prerequisites

- Story exists with status APPROVED_FOR_REFINEMENT and complete business context
- Product Owner has manually approved story for technical refinement

- Share implementation patterns and solutions that benefit future development work
- Document best practices and lessons learned for team knowledge sharing
- Update technical standards and preferences based on refinement experience

### 6. Validate Enhancement Quality

#### 6.1 Story Completeness Check
- Verify that all business requirements are addressed by implementation tasks
- Ensure technical approach delivers original user value and business outcomes
- Confirm that acceptance criteria can be validated through implementation tasks
- Check that story scope remains appropriate for development iteration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Technical approach becomes too complex or over-engineered for business requirements
**Solution**: Refocus on user outcomes, simplify approach, validate business value alignment

**Issue**: Development tasks are too vague or high-level for effective implementation
**Solution**: Break down further, add technical details, include file specifications and patterns

**Issue**: Business value gets lost in technical implementation details
**Solution**: Preserve original acceptance criteria, validate user outcomes, maintain business context

**Issue**: Enhancement session doesn't reach agreement on technical approach
**Solution**: Escalate architectural questions, gather additional context, schedule follow-up session
