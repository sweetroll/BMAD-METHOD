# Story Refinement Task

This task guides the collaborative refinement of high-level business stories into actionable development tasks through Tech Lead and Developer collaboration.

## Purpose

Transform business-focused user stories into implementation-ready development work through collaborative technical elaboration, maintaining business value while adding just-in-time technical detail.

## When to Use This Task

### 4. Create Implementation Task Breakdown

#### 4.1 Sequential Task Planning
- Break story into logical development tasks
- Sequence tasks based on dependencies and risk
- Estimate effort and complexity for each task
- Ensure each task has clear acceptance criteria

#### 4.2 Task Definition
- Write clear descriptions for each development task

- Include implementation notes and guidance

#### 4.3 Integration Planning
- Plan how tasks integrate into complete feature
- Define testing strategy for individual tasks and overall feature
- Plan deployment and configuration requirements
- Consider rollback and error recovery approaches

### 5. Document Refinement Results

#### 5.1 Create Story Refinement Document
- Use story-refinement-tmpl to document the session
- Capture collaborative discussion and decisions made
- Record technical approach and implementation strategy
- Document task breakdown with clear dependencies

#### 5.2 Update Story with Technical Context
- Enhance original story with technical acceptance criteria
- Add technical notes and implementation guidance
- Include reference to refinement document
- Update story status to "Ready for Development"

#### 5.3 Create Supporting Documentation
- Document key technical decisions using tech-decision-tmpl
- Create implementation plan using implementation-plan-tmpl
- Update workflow status to reflect refinement completion
- Prepare handoff briefing for developer

### 6. Validate Refinement Quality

#### 6.1 Completeness Check
- Verify all business requirements are addressed technically
- Ensure technical approach maintains business value
- Confirm architectural alignment is preserved
- Check that developer has clear implementation path

#### 6.2 Collaboration Quality
- Confirm developer agreement with technical approach
- Validate that developer input was incorporated effectively
- Ensure technical decisions are well-reasoned and documented
- Verify understanding of business context is maintained

#### 6.3 Implementation Readiness
- Check that tasks are actionable and specific
- Verify acceptance criteria are testable and clear
- Ensure dependencies are properly sequenced
- Confirm resources and tools are available

## Expected Outputs

### Primary Documents
- **Story Refinement Document**: Complete record of collaborative refinement session
- **Updated User Story**: Enhanced with technical context and implementation guidance
- **Technical Decision Records**: Documentation of key technical choices and rationale
- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed task breakdown ready for development

### Secondary Artifacts
- **Task Breakdown**: Sequenced development tasks with estimates
- **Technical Design**: Component and integration design decisions
- **Testing Strategy**: Approach for validating implementation
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical risks and mitigation strategies

## Quality Criteria

### Successful Refinement Characteristics
- **Business Value Preserved**: Technical implementation maintains user and business value
- **Collaborative Decisions**: Developer input incorporated into technical approach
- **Architectural Alignment**: Implementation approach aligns with strategic architecture
- **Implementation Ready**: Clear, actionable tasks with specific acceptance criteria
- **Context Maintained**: Business context preserved through technical elaboration

### Common Refinement Issues to Avoid
- **Business Value Loss**: Technical complexity overshadows user value
- **Prescriptive Design**: Tech Lead dictates without developer collaboration
- **Architectural Drift**: Implementation approach conflicts with strategic decisions
- **Premature Optimization**: Over-engineering for unclear requirements
- **Context Fragmentation**: Business intent lost in technical details

## Success Metrics

### Refinement Quality Indicators
- Developer can begin implementation immediately without additional clarification
- Business stakeholders recognize their requirements in technical approach
- Architectural principles are maintained in implementation design
- Technical decisions are well-reasoned and documented
- Implementation tasks are appropriately sized and sequenced

### Collaboration Effectiveness Metrics
- Developer actively contributed to technical approach selection
- Technical decisions incorporate both business needs and implementation reality
- Refinement session maintained focus on user value delivery
- All participants understand and agree with outcomes

## Tips for Effective Refinement

### Before the Session
- **Prepare Context**: Review business and technical background thoroughly
- **Set Expectations**: Clarify collaborative nature and shared decision-making
- **Gather Resources**: Have architectural decisions and business requirements accessible
- **Plan Time**: Allow adequate time for thorough discussion and decision-making

### During the Session
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: Encourage developer input and technical expertise
- **Maintain Business Focus**: Keep user value and business outcomes visible
- **Document Decisions**: Capture rationale for technical choices as they're made
- **Validate Understanding**: Confirm shared understanding of approach and tasks

### After the Session
- **Complete Documentation**: Finish all refinement documents promptly
- **Validate Quality**: Review outputs for completeness and clarity
- **Enable Handoff**: Prepare clear handoff to developer with full context
- **Plan Follow-up**: Establish support and check-in approach for implementation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Developer and Tech Lead disagree on technical approach
**Solution**: Focus on business value and architectural constraints, explore compromise solutions, escalate to architect if needed

**Issue**: Business requirements are unclear or conflicting
**Solution**: Pause refinement, gather clarification from business stakeholders, document assumptions clearly

**Issue**: Technical complexity exceeds story scope
**Solution**: Consider story splitting, identify minimum viable implementation, plan technical debt management

**Issue**: Architectural constraints conflict with optimal implementation
**Solution**: Understand constraint rationale, explore creative solutions, escalate architectural discussion if needed
