# Implementation Planning Task

This task guides the creation of detailed implementation plans that bridge refined user stories into actionable development work with clear tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

## Purpose

Transform collaboratively refined technical designs into comprehensive implementation plans with sequential development tasks, clear acceptance criteria, and support structures that enable effective development execution.

## When to Use This Task

- **After Story Refinement**: When technical approach has been collaboratively designed
- **Before Development Begins**: When detailed task breakdown is needed
- **For Complex Features**: When implementation requires careful sequencing and coordination
- **Team Coordination**: When multiple developers or clear handoffs are needed

## Prerequisites

- Story refinement session has been completed with technical approach defined
- Technical decisions have been documented with implementation guidance
- Developer collaboration has resulted in agreed-upon implementation strategy
- Business context and acceptance criteria are clear and stable

## Inputs Required

- **Refined Story**: Story with technical approach and collaborative design decisions
- **Technical Decisions**: Documented technical choices and implementation guidance
- **Architecture Context**: Strategic architecture decisions and technical constraints
- **Resource Context**: Developer skills, available time, and project timeline

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Implementation Scope

- Include user acceptance testing or stakeholder review requirements

#### 4.3 Validation and Deployment Planning
- Plan approach for validating implementation against original business requirements
- Define deployment strategy and environment requirements
- Consider rollback procedures and risk mitigation for production deployment
- Plan monitoring and observability for feature performance in production

### 5. Address Risk and Support Planning

#### 5.1 Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- Identify technical risks associated with implementation approach
- Plan mitigation strategies for high-probability or high-impact risks
- Consider contingency plans for critical implementation challenges
- Document escalation procedures for technical blockers or issues

#### 5.2 Resource and Support Planning
- Identify what resources, tools, or environments are needed for implementation
- Plan for technical support and expertise availability during development
- Consider training or knowledge transfer needs for complex technologies
- Establish communication and coordination protocols for team collaboration

#### 5.3 Timeline and Milestone Planning
- Create realistic timeline estimates based on task breakdown and dependencies
- Identify key milestones and delivery checkpoints throughout implementation
- Plan buffer time for integration, testing, and issue resolution
- Coordinate timeline with broader project schedule and stakeholder expectations

### 6. Create Implementation Plan Documentation

#### 6.1 Comprehensive Plan Creation
- Use implementation-plan-tmpl to create detailed implementation documentation
- Include all task breakdowns, dependencies, and acceptance criteria
- Document testing strategy, quality gates, and validation approach
- Provide timeline, resource requirements, and support plans

#### 6.2 Developer Handoff Package
- Prepare complete handoff documentation for development team
- Include all technical context, decisions, and implementation guidance

- Establish communication and support protocols for implementation period

#### 6.3 Stakeholder Communication Plan
- Create executive summary of implementation approach and timeline
- Plan regular status updates and milestone communication to stakeholders
- Define demo and review schedules for business stakeholder validation
- Establish escalation procedures for significant issues or scope changes

### 7. Validate Implementation Plan Quality

#### 7.1 Completeness Review

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Task breakdown is too complex or overwhelming for developers
**Solution**: Simplify task structure, reduce task scope, provide more implementation guidance

**Issue**: Timeline estimates prove unrealistic during implementation
**Solution**: Re-evaluate complexity factors, adjust scope or timeline, improve estimation process

**Issue**: Integration points cause delays or technical conflicts
**Solution**: Improve dependency analysis, plan integration testing earlier, coordinate with related teams

**Issue**: Quality gates slow development progress significantly
**Solution**: Streamline quality processes, provide better testing tools, adjust quality standards appropriately
