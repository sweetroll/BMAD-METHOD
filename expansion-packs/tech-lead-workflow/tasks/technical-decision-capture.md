## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Participants disagree on what was actually decided
**Solution**: Reconvene decision-making session, seek explicit agreement, document any remaining disagreements

**Issue**: Decision rationale is unclear or seems arbitrary
**Solution**: Revisit business context and evaluation criteria, document decision factors more thoroughly

**Issue**: Implementation guidance is too vague for developers
**Solution**: Add specific examples, code patterns, or step-by-step guidance, consult with developers

**Issue**: Decision conflicts with other technical decisions or architecture
**Solution**: Review architectural alignment, resolve conflicts with architect, update related decisions
