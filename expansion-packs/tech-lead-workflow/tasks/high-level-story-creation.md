# High-Level Story Creation Task

This task guides the creation of business-focused user stories that capture user value and business requirements without premature technical implementation details.

## Purpose

Create high-level user stories that focus on business value, user outcomes, and acceptance criteria while avoiding technical implementation details that will be collaboratively elaborated later by the Tech Lead.

## Tips for Effective High-Level Story Creation

### Before Story Creation
- **Understand Users**: Research actual user needs and workflows thoroughly
- **Clarify Business Value**: Ensure clear understanding of business objectives and success criteria
- **Review Architecture**: Understand strategic technical context without getting into implementation details
- **Engage Stakeholders**: Gather input from product owners and business representatives

### During Story Creation
- **Stay User-Focused**: Keep user needs and outcomes at center of story development
- **Avoid Technical Details**: Focus on what user outcomes to achieve, not how to implement
- **Document Context**: Provide rich business context for effective technical refinement
- **Think Testing**: Write acceptance criteria that can be validated from user perspective

### After Story Creation
- **Review with Stakeholders**: Validate story accuracy with business representatives
- **Prepare for Refinement**: Ensure story provides sufficient context for technical collaboration
- **Plan Communication**: Establish ongoing communication and feedback protocols
- **Monitor Quality**: Use checklist validation to ensure story meets quality standards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Story contains technical implementation details or constraints
**Solution**: Refocus on user outcomes and business value, remove technical prescriptions, prepare technical questions for refinement

**Issue**: Acceptance criteria are vague or difficult to test
**Solution**: Use "Given/When/Then" format, focus on observable user behavior, ensure criteria are specific and measurable

**Issue**: Business value or user benefit is unclear
**Solution**: Engage with product owners and users, research user problems more thoroughly, quantify business value where possible

**Issue**: Story scope is too large or complex for single iteration
**Solution**: Break story into smaller components, focus on core user value first, plan phased delivery approach
