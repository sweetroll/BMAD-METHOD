  Tech Lead Workflow Extension ready!

  Key Changes:
  - "Barry (/architect): High-level strategic architecture without implementation details"
  - "Bruce (/sm): Business-focused story creation with HIGH_LEVEL status"
  - "Beryl (/tech-lead): Collaborative technical refinement with manual review gates"
  - Enhanced story workflow with status management

  Workflow:
  1. Bruce creates HIGH_LEVEL stories
  2. Manual Gate 1: HIGH_LEVEL → APPROVED_FOR_REFINEMENT
  3. Beryl enhances stories with developer steps → PENDING_DEVELOPMENT_APPROVAL
  4. Manual Gate 2: PENDING_DEVELOPMENT_APPROVAL → APPROVED
  5. BMAD dev agent implements when status = APPROVED

  Features:
  - "Just-in-time technical elaboration"
  - Manual review gates for control
  - "Tech lead knowledge base for cross-story insights"
  - Full compatibility with existing BMAD dev agent
