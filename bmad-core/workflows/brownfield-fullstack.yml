  sequence:
    - step: project_analysis
      agent: architect
      action: analyze existing project and use task document-project
      creates: multiple documents per the document-project template
      notes: "Review existing documentation, codebase structure, and identify integration points. Document current system understanding before proceeding."

      notes: "Creates brownfield architecture with integration strategy and existing system constraints. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final brownfield-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all brownfield documents for integration safety and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - Architectural changes are needed
      - Significant integration work required
      - Risk assessment and mitigation planning necessary
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes
