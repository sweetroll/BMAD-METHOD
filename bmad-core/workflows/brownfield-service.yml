  name: Brownfield Service/API Enhancement
  description: >-
    Agent workflow for enhancing existing backend services and APIs with new features,
    modernization, or performance improvements. Handles existing system analysis and safe integration.
  type: brownfield
  project_types:
    - service-modernization
    - api-enhancement
    - microservice-extraction
    - performance-optimization
    - integration-enhancement

  sequence:
    - step: service_analysis
     agent: architect
      action: analyze existing project and use task document-project
      creates: multiple documents per the document-project template
      notes: "Review existing service documentation, codebase, performance metrics, and identify integration dependencies."

    - agent: pm
      creates: brownfield-prd.md
      uses: brownfield-prd-tmpl
      requires: existing_service_analysis
      notes: "Creates comprehensive brownfield PRD focused on service enhancement with existing system analysis. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final brownfield-prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: architect
      creates: brownfield-architecture.md
      uses: brownfield-architecture-tmpl
      requires: brownfield-prd.md
      notes: "Creates brownfield architecture with service integration strategy and API evolution planning. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final brownfield-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all brownfield documents for service integration safety and API compatibility. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - workflow_end:

      notes: "All planning artifacts complete. Move to IDE environment to begin development. Explain to the user the IDE Development Workflow next steps: data#bmad-kb:IDE Development Workflow"

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Service enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - API versioning or breaking changes needed
      - Database schema changes required
      - Performance or scalability improvements needed
      - Multiple integration points affected
